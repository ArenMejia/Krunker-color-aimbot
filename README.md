# Krunker-color-aimbot
UNPATCHABLE Color-based aimbot for the game krunker.io 

## MAKE SURE YOU RUN GAME IN FULL SCREEN! 
### Otherwise it may not work as well 

In order to run this script, you need to download AutoHotKey from https://autohotkey.com 

Download "krunker_aimbot - public.ahk" 

To use, aim in the general direction of the target player, then hold the right mouse button. 
This aimbot works by searching the screen for certain colors. 

## LeKrunk.ahk was a collab between Leplix and I. However, it only works on 1080p. 
### Krunker_Aimbot - public.ahk will work on all resolutions. 

Video coming soon. 

A better version of the cheat with more features is also coming, but it will come at a price...
